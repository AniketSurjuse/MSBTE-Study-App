In order to solve those problem me and my project group members decided to develop something like which solve those above problem, and now a days student has very much matured with mobile application and other study web sites so that we have to Develop study application which is mainly oriented on MSBTE Diploma course for Computer Department Students. In this application we provided proper videos, chapter wise notes, and practice quizzes which must need to solve those quiz and qualify minimum criteria for accessing next chapter study materials. Conclusion of these project are, students must be aware about there Diploma course and there scope, and also property of this project is it will force the to student qualify minimum criteria because of that student need to study this course material get access to the next study materials so that they will automatically prepared for there End semester Exams. Significance of project is it will strictly follow the curriculum of MSBTE and it will force the student to qualify there exam so that he/she automatically prepared for there End Semester Exams and after completing hole syllabus it will show analytical result on the basis of chapter wise quiz and final exam quiz</p>

## Introduction
<p align="justify">This one of the mobile application which is run on Android platform which is easily accessible to students with the help of there portability property student can access there study materials anywhere and anytime, not they can prepare only but they can attend the lectures video which is perfectly oriented on MSBTE curriculum and at the end of each chapter they gives quiz which is mandatory to solve and clear the minimum criteria for accessing next chapter material and it will cover entire syllabus of Diploma students. At the last it will gives Result analysis on the basis of unit wise quiz score.</p>

## Background of industry or user based problem
<p align="justify">There are various application available in Google Play Store when we search ' MSBTE app ', in results it will shows so many application but most of the application provide only previous year paper and model answer paper and some are not properly developed which does not have an any content it just dummy structure of application, that why we need such a application which cover entire MSBTE curriculum in only single application and one of the most important feature feature is, at the end of 4 sem student need to do internship for there 5 sem, that why we decided to gives any one course which will complete there internship also.</p>

## Literature Survey
<p align="justify">As we have conduct one small survey for studies about various e-learning website and mobile application regarding to that results we observed one or tow things which is does not cover those website and app. when we search ' MSBTE app ', on Google Play Store in results it will shows so many application but most of the application provide only previous year paper and and model answer paper and some are not properly developed which does not have an any content it just dummy structure of application.</p>

<p align="justify">When we visit some popular platform related to learning like Udemy, Coursera, Internshala we observe one think that will follow their owns curriculum, but what about government define course.</p>

<p align="justify">As I defined above problem we have to decided to developed application which will strictly follow the syllabus of Maharashtra state bord of technical education. For that purpose we will visit some popular websites and study there GUI and mechanism and there Databases, and also study about there working, one think I observed regarding to Udemy is there knowledge and course are well and good but their faculty refer very high standard English which is very problematic to understand any INDIAN undergraduate students and one Plus point about that is it provides very very well courses and knowledge in very affordable fees structure that is something near about 400 to 500 Rs.</p>

<p align="justify">When we talk about Coursera e-learning platform it is one of best website well reputed, it will gives best knowledge and there learning duration is also some larger and and there quizzes are also very tough all this are very good but when we think about there fees structure it is very heigh which is not affordable to any middle class students specially for any INDIAN undergraduate student there fees are around 4000 to 4500 Rs.</p>

<p align="justify">When I visit the Internshala platform this is one of the best platform for doing an  internship for undergraduate student it will give very short & perfect content in very basic English which is easily understand any INDIAN 10 and +2 students and also undergraduate students and there fees are also affordable it was around 1200 Rs.</p>

<p align="justify">All these platforms which i explain there pros and, cons are good the common problems about those are it does not follow any government defined syllabus. It was follows only there owns syllabus.</p>

<p align="justify">For solving all above problem i.e. high cost, syllabus, government defined cource. We decided develop such app which provides course in free off cost, and follow standard syllabus, and which will completely based on Government defined curriculum that is specifically for MSBTE Computer Department. Features and properties of this application is detailed explan in proposed details Methodology.
